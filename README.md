# Existential-Maze-Game

Existential Maze Game will be a simple, maze traversal game that will be pretentiously existential because the writer of the game thinks he's the second coming of Albert Camus. 

The idea for this came came to me when learning about spanning tree algorithms. 

The game is currently a work in progress.
